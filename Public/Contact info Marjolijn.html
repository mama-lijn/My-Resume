        <h5>It would be nice hearing from you, maybe you can tell me how to make a link for the email address :-) or how to make smileys, or maybe if you are interested in the same things as me (see <a href="./About me Marjolijn.html">About me Marjolijn</a>) or if you have other kindly things that you would like to share with me.<h5>
        <h5>Okay I've found out an "address" element that it's not working yet, nor is it in line with the text I wrote, but hey I'm one step closer (while it already looks like a link :-).</h5>
