<p><h2>Hello thank you for taking interest in me :-)</h2></p>
<p><h3>Below I'll tell you a little bit more about myself.</h3></p>
<p><h4>I'm a 40 year old mother of a lovely boy. And I've been working and learning for the past 25 years.</h4></p>
<p><h4>Learning new skills and exploring new fields is a necessary thing for me to be happy. Therefore I've already became a skilled nursing, customs expert and business engineering. Due to the changing world (digitalization) and the opportunities this brings in my job I want to learn/know more about coding. While I've spent hours and hours making the most efficient Excel files to sort data and extract information. And sitting next to the IT guys seeing them coding the solutions I've ask them to implement. I want to be able to do that myself. And I've noticed that I like the process thinking and creating things that way. That's why I made a start to learn how to code.... and maybe also a little bit because I'm to stubborn to accept, that if anybody says something I thought of, is not possible, I want to find out for myself if it's really not possible. And maybe meanwhile even explore better or bigger things to optimize a process.</h4></p>
<p><h4>I see myself as a visionaire. Unfortunatly, not in the kind that has revolutionary ideas/solutions on how to achief world peace. But on a smaller level, the kind that sees the complete picture of an e.g. organization and is able to all details in a structured way. Yes I know, my head can't "just accept" information but needs to see the system behind it. Once I've scanned the (in this case) organization. I'm well informed to know where the hiccups are and what to do about it. Or what the effect from changes in the system will be. It makes me very happy to add value to the world by making processes more efficient but also making the tasks of my colleagues more suitable to their needs.</h4></p>
<p><h4>Maybe now it looks like working and learning is the only thing I do in my life. Well in some way, it's correct, but although there is a big grey area between work and spare time. When I'm not working I like to take care of my son. And I'm learning a lot from him. And also I've made a start to create an "off grid" home for me and my son. The term off grid maybe sounds a bit extreme, but I'm finding out how we can make a more self-supporting, sustainable home. By learning how to grow our own vegetables, I'm making preparations to have a chicken coop, at the moment and I'm thinking about how I can upgrade my current house by using natural products such as cod and wood. And I'm exploring the possibilities on how I can combine different systems to have an optimal sustainable energy and heating system.</h4></p>
<p><h4>Meanwhile doing the things described above, I love to cook, bake, eat, sleep, dance, drink tea and sometimes wine with friends and family, watch television, read a book or magazine and go on holidays, or just waist time by doing nothing at all.</h4></p>
